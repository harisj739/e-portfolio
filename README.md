# My Personal Portfolio (v1.0.0)
This portfolio contains all the files and their brief descriptions that I used to create my own e-portfolio website. 

As my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Node.js grew, I implemented more features, creating a full scale web application.

## HTML Files
1. [Home Page](index.html)
   - The home page is divided into 3 main sections: the header, the main content, and the footer. The header simply contains a decorated and centered text of my name. The main content is              indicated by the horizontal line and begins with the navigation bar. Under the naviagtion bar, an image of the Golden Gate Bridge is displayed alongside paragraphs introducing myself using       a flexbox display. The footer embeds a small image alongside small text containing a copyright and a disclaimer using a flexbox display.
2. [About Page](about.html)
   - The about page is divided into the same 3 main sections: the header, the main content, and the footer. Differing from the home page, a table containing two columns and three rows is              displayed, showcasing my programming experience. Under this table are multiple paragraphs highlighting my interests. At the bottom of the main content lies a dropdown that provides contact       methods to reach me.
3. [Contact Page](contact.html)
   - The about page is divided into the same 3 main sections: the header, the main content, and the footer. Differing from the other two pages, a google form is embedded using the <iframe> tag        that asks for the vistor's contact information. 

## CSS Files
1. [Styling](style.css)
   - The CSS file styles the each web pages using an array of methods: through tag, id, and class selectors in addition to pseudo classes.

## Node.js Files
